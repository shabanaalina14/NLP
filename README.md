# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP combines elements of computer science, linguistics, and cognitive psychology.

Key Areas of NLP:

Text Analysis: Extracting insights from textual data, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.

Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another using models like Google's Neural Machine Translation (GNMT).

Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text, as seen in virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.

Information Retrieval: Finding and retrieving relevant information from large datasets, such as search engines.
